👋 Hi, I’m @FlipWhale
👀 I’m interested in blockchain development, Web3, AI-driven solutions, and front-end architecture using the latest technologies like React, Next.js, Streamlit, Vue, and Tailwind CSS.
🌱 I’m currently learning more about decentralized applications (dApps), smart contracts, and scaling AI tools for financial analysis and trading as well as making scalable isomorphic apps.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on innovative projects in Web3, crypto, hackathons, and full-stack development with a focus on performance and UX optimization.
